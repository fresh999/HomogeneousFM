class AffineProbPath(ProbPath):
    r'''The ``AffineProbPath`` class represents a specific type of probability path where the transformation between distributions is affine.
    An affine transformation can be represented as:

    .. math::

        X_t = \alpha_t X_1 + \sigma_t X_0,

    where :math:`X_t` is the transformed data point at time `t`. :math:`X_0` and :math:`X_1` are the source and target data points, respectively. :math:`\alpha_t` and :math:`\sigma_t` are the parameters of the affine transformation at time `t`.

    The scheduler is responsible for providing the time-dependent parameters :math:`\alpha_t` and :math:`\sigma_t`, as well as their derivatives, which define the affine transformation at any given time `t`.

    Using ``AffineProbPath`` in the flow matching framework:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Instantiates a probability path
        my_path = AffineProbPath(...)
        mse_loss = torch.nn.MSELoss()

        for x_1 in dataset:
            # Sets x_0 to random noise
            x_0 = torch.randn()

            # Sets t to a random value in [0,1]
            t = torch.rand()

            # Samples the conditional path X_t ~ p_t(X_t|X_0,X_1)
            path_sample = my_path.sample(x_0=x_0, x_1=x_1, t=t)

            # Computes the MSE loss w.r.t. the velocity
            loss = mse_loss(path_sample.dx_t, my_model(x_t, t))
            loss.backward()

    Args:
        scheduler (Scheduler): An instance of a scheduler that provides the parameters :math:`\alpha_t`, :math:`\sigma_t`, and their derivatives over time.

    def sample(self, x_0: torch.Tensor, x_1: torch.Tensor) -> PathSample:

        Args:
            x_0 (Tensor): source data point, shape (batch_size, ...).
            x_1 (Tensor): target data point, shape (batch_size, ...).
